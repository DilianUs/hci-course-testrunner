# Activities Management

The following section defines the management of activities carried out during the project. The metrics applied around the activities are specified, as well as the completion process of each activity.

## Definition of Done

The direct exposure of the work team to the activities to be performed is done by means of a Trello board, in Kanban format.

This is composed of 4 sections: **To Do, Doing, Review & Done**. All activities start initially in the **To Do** section, and must go through all the sections until they reach the **Done** section.

### To Do
Initially specifies all the activities to be carried out during the course. A brief paragraph should be added describing in general terms what each activity is about.

### Doing
Section for all activities that are currently in the process of implementation. For an activity to be moved from **To Do** to **Doing**, the following requirements must be met:

- At least one team member in charge of that activity must have been assigned to it.
- An HH KPI value must have been established.
- A due date must be specified.
- a description of what is to be done should be added
- It should have been specified whether an artifact should be obtained by solving the activity.

Finally, an activity must pass to the **Doing** state once the member/members assigned to the activity start to work on its resolution. 

### Review

Once the member/members in charge of an activity finish with the resolution procedure, have generated the corresponding artifacts (in case the activity implies it) and under their criteria have completed the specification of what has been requested, the activity must pass to the Â¨**Review** state.

In this activity, a Verification & Validation process must be performed to verify that what was done during the **Doing** phase is fundamentally correct, that it complies with the entire activity specification and that it's error free.


### Done
For an activity to be moved to **Done** status, the V&V procedure must have produced satisfactory results or the required corrections must have been made.

## Human-Hour KPI (HH)
The Human-Hour KPI is the unit of measurement used in project management to measure the effort required to complete a task.

An Human-Hour is defined as one hour of uninterrupted effort by an average worker.

For the calculation of Human-Hours, all team members are considered to have the same capabilities and work performance, so that 1 Human-Hour is worth the same for each individual.

For project issues, 3 different Human-Hour scores are established:

- 1 KPI
- 2 KPI
- 3 KPI

The equivalence in Human-Hours for each score is illustrated in the table below:

| --- | 1 KPI | 2 KPI | 3 KPI |
| --- | --- |---|---|
| **Resolution**| 1 - 2 Hours | 3 - 4 Hours | 5 - 8 Hours |
| **V&V**| 1 hour | 1 Hour | 1 - 2 Hours |
| **Total Hours**| 2 - 3 Hours | 4 - 5 Hours | 6 - 10 Hours |


## Percentage of On-Time Completion KPI (OTC)


| Percentage | Status |
| --- | --- |
| 0% - 20% | Zero Performance |
| 21% - 40% | Deficient |
| 41% - 60% | Complicated |
| 61% - 80% | Acceptable |
| 81% - 100% | Desirable |
