# Traceability Matrix
| Requirement Code | Description | Design artefact | Responsable |
|:--:|--|--|--|
| RF 1 | The system should be able to detect the user's OS without the user having to specify it, in order to install dependencies and configure environment variables.  | [Mid fidelity 1.1(Desktop-9)](https://www.figma.com/file/BRmxXYkRPCorbYL4aXitR2/Guia-de-dise%C3%B1o?type=design&node-id=86%3A52&mode=design&t=AcVGtrjYayomeJLt-1) |
| RF 2 | The system must have the option to install the required dependencies the first time the extension is configured. The user will be able to decide if they wants certain dependencies to be installed and select them manually (in case the user already has some dependencies installed), or if they wants to skip this option.  | [Mid fidelity 1.1(Desktop-9)](https://www.figma.com/file/BRmxXYkRPCorbYL4aXitR2/Guia-de-dise%C3%B1o?type=design&node-id=86%3A52&mode=design&t=AcVGtrjYayomeJLt-1) |
| RF 3 | The system must be able to add the installation path of the dependencies to the OS environment variables.  | [Mid fidelity 1.1(Desktop-9)](https://www.figma.com/file/BRmxXYkRPCorbYL4aXitR2/Guia-de-dise%C3%B1o?type=design&node-id=86%3A52&mode=design&t=AcVGtrjYayomeJLt-1) |
| RF 4 | The system must be able to install the Test-Runner tool through the dependency manager npm.  | [Mid fidelity 1.1(Desktop-9)](https://www.figma.com/file/BRmxXYkRPCorbYL4aXitR2/Guia-de-dise%C3%B1o?type=design&node-id=86%3A52&mode=design&t=AcVGtrjYayomeJLt-1) |
| RF 5 | The system shall display a tab describing how the extension works, as well as the commands that the user can use to interact with it, and the new sections added by the extension.  | [Mid fidelity 1.1(Frame-7)](http://mid-fidelity) |
| RF 6 | The system shall show, for each test present in the repository folder individually, if it has already been executed and has passed the test, or if on the contrary it has not passed the test.  | [Mid fidelity 1.1(Desktop-9)](https://www.figma.com/file/BRmxXYkRPCorbYL4aXitR2/Guia-de-dise%C3%B1o?type=design&node-id=86%3A51&mode=design&t=AcVGtrjYayomeJLt-1) |
| RF 7 | The system shall show, at the repository folder level, whether all tests have been executed and passed, or if not all tests have passed.  | [Mid fidelity 1.1(Desktop-9)](https://www.figma.com/file/BRmxXYkRPCorbYL4aXitR2/Guia-de-dise%C3%B1o?type=design&node-id=86%3A51&mode=design&t=AcVGtrjYayomeJLt-1) |
| RF 8 | The system must be capable of running each of the tests individually.  | [Mid fidelity 1.1(Desktop-9)](https://www.figma.com/file/BRmxXYkRPCorbYL4aXitR2/Guia-de-dise%C3%B1o?type=design&node-id=86%3A52&mode=design&t=AcVGtrjYayomeJLt-1) |
| RF 9 | The system should be able to batch run all tests from the repository folder.  | [Mid fidelity 1.1(Desktop-9)](https://www.figma.com/file/BRmxXYkRPCorbYL4aXitR2/Guia-de-dise%C3%B1o?type=design&node-id=86%3A52&mode=design&t=AcVGtrjYayomeJLt-1) |
| RF 10 | During the execution of the tests, the system shall have the option to stop the execution of the test at any time.  | [Mid fidelity 1.1(Desktop-9)](https://www.figma.com/file/BRmxXYkRPCorbYL4aXitR2/Guia-de-dise%C3%B1o?type=design&node-id=86%3A51&mode=design&t=AcVGtrjYayomeJLt-1) |
| RF 11 | The system shall be able to display the execution of the tests performed from the output returned by the Test-Runner tool.  | [Mid fidelity 1.1(Desktop-9)](https://www.figma.com/file/BRmxXYkRPCorbYL4aXitR2/Guia-de-dise%C3%B1o?type=design&node-id=86%3A51&mode=design&t=AcVGtrjYayomeJLt-1) |
| RF 12 | The system shall update the status of a test individually once it has been executed.  | [Mid fidelity 1.1(Desktop-9)](https://www.figma.com/file/BRmxXYkRPCorbYL4aXitR2/Guia-de-dise%C3%B1o?type=design&node-id=86%3A51&mode=design&t=AcVGtrjYayomeJLt-1) |
| RF 13 | The system shall update the status of the tests at the repository folder level once they have been executed.  | [Mid fidelity 1.1(Desktop-9)](https://www.figma.com/file/BRmxXYkRPCorbYL4aXitR2/Guia-de-dise%C3%B1o?type=design&node-id=86%3A51&mode=design&t=AcVGtrjYayomeJLt-1) |
