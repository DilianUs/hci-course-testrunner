# Prototype Development  
## Description  
Prototype development is an essential part of our design to test the usability, functionality and UX in the Test Runner project. For this project we made three types of prototypes, a low-fidelity prototype, a mid-fidelity prototype, and a high-fidelity for the following elements of the project:  
* Extension installation.
* Extension help.
* Result visualization.
* Feedback Screen states.  
## Design Guide  
The color pallete, fonts, line spacing and some designs are shown in this section. As most of these elements are only considered in the High-Fidelity prototype, we only consider the design guide for said instance of the prototype.
