# Prototype Development  
## Description  
Prototype development is an essential part of our design to test the usability, functionality and UX in the Test Runner project. For this project we made three types of prototypes, a low-fidelity prototype, a mid-fidelity prototype, and a high-fidelity for the following elements of the project:  
* Extension installation.
* Extension help.
* Result visualization.
* Feedback Screen states.  
## Design Guide  
The color pallete, fonts, line spacing and some designs are shown in this section. As most of these elements are only considered in the High-Fidelity prototype, we only consider the design guide for said instance of the prototype.  
## Prototypes  
[Low-Fidelity Prototype](https://www.figma.com/file/BRmxXYkRPCorbYL4aXitR2/Guia-de-dise%C3%B1o?type=design&node-id=0%3A2&mode=design&t=PoyhKkyY1GtIc5H9-1)  
In this prototype the objective was to derminate the frame layout of the information that is going to be presented during the run of the functionalities.  
[Mid-Fidelity Prototype](https://www.figma.com/file/BRmxXYkRPCorbYL4aXitR2/Guia-de-dise%C3%B1o?type=design&node-id=164%3A2&mode=design&t=PoyhKkyY1GtIc5H9-1)  
To establish what was going to be included in this instance of the prototype we decided to make the low-fidelity and the high-fidelity prototypes  
This way we could take both extremes of the specific atributes and trace a middle ground between them. Therefore the elements presented don't include most of the Design Guide, like  UI color and design, and scaled font size but it does takes in consideration the placement of the information and not only in reference of the screen placement but the size of paragraph, and elements of the information.  
[High-Fidelity Prototype](https://www.figma.com/file/BRmxXYkRPCorbYL4aXitR2/Guia-de-dise%C3%B1o?type=design&node-id=165%3A2&mode=design&t=PoyhKkyY1GtIc5H9-1)  
This prototype was made before the mid-fidelity prototype. In this case, it considers all te Design Guide and shows the proper use of said guide. The information now looks the closest as possible as it would in the IDE.
