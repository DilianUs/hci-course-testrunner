## Description
This document includes the design that the testing team must follow for the application of the Usability Tests corresponding to the ***"Extension of the Test Runner aimed at students"*** project. Likewise, the elements to be considered during its application are detailed. 

## Selection of Priority RNFs

The Non-Functional Requirements selected for the usability tests application are all those that have reached a **High Priority** level. It should be noted that the establishment of priority levels occurred through the identification of usability problems during the application of the Exploratory Tests. You can see the individual reports for each of the Exploratory Tests [here](../Exploratory%20Tests/Exploratory%20Tests%20Reports/).


The NFRs with a **High Priority** level are listed below: 

- [NFR 4: Test Scores](../../Requirements/Requirements%20Definition.md#nfr-4)
- [NFR 5: User Operational Simplicity](../../Requirements/Requirements%20Definition.md#nfr-5)
- [NFR 6: Simplicity in the User Interface](../../Requirements/Requirements%20Definition.md#nfr-6)
- [NFR 7: Ease of Use](../../Requirements/Requirements%20Definition.md#nfr-7)
- [NFR 8: Clarity of User Interfaces](../../Requirements/Requirements%20Definition.md#nfr-8)

> Note: The [NFR 2: Ease of configuration](../../Requirements/Requirements%20Definition.md#nfr-2) was discarded due to the problems presented by McCall in the reference included in the definition of the quality attribute Understandability. Originally, this NFR had a High Priority level

Likewise, the Quality Attributes related to the NFR with High Priority are listed below:

- [Satisfaction](../../Requirements/Requirements%20Definition.md#satisfaction)
- [Simplicity](../../Requirements/Requirements%20Definition.md#simplicity)
- [Efficiency](../../Requirements/Requirements%20Definition.md#efficiency)
