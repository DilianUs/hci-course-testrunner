## Description
This document includes the design that the testing team must follow for the application of the Usability Tests corresponding to the ***"Extension of the Test Runner aimed at students"*** project. Likewise, the elements to be considered during its application are detailed. 

## Selection of Priority RNFs

The Non-Functional Requirements selected for the usability tests application are all those that have reached a **High Priority** level. It should be noted that the establishment of priority levels occurred through the identification of usability problems during the application of the Exploratory Tests. You can see the individual reports for each of the Exploratory Tests [here](../Exploratory%20Tests/Exploratory%20Tests%20Reports/).


The NFRs with a **High Priority** level are listed below: 

- [NFR 4: Test Scores](../../Requirements/Requirements%20Definition.md#nfr-4)
- [NFR 5: User Operational Simplicity](../../Requirements/Requirements%20Definition.md#nfr-5)
- [NFR 6: Simplicity in the User Interface](../../Requirements/Requirements%20Definition.md#nfr-6)
- [NFR 7: Ease of Use](../../Requirements/Requirements%20Definition.md#nfr-7)
- [NFR 8: Clarity of User Interfaces](../../Requirements/Requirements%20Definition.md#nfr-8)

> **Note:** The [NFR 2: Ease of configuration](../../Requirements/Requirements%20Definition.md#nfr-2) was discarded due to the problems presented by McCall in the reference included in the definition of the Quality Attribute [Understandability](../../Requirements/Requirements%20Definition.md#understandability). Originally, this NFR had a High Priority level

Likewise, the Quality Attributes related to the NFR with High Priority are listed below:

- [Satisfaction](../../Requirements/Requirements%20Definition.md#satisfaction)
- [Simplicity](../../Requirements/Requirements%20Definition.md#simplicity)
- [Efficiency](../../Requirements/Requirements%20Definition.md#efficiency)

 

## Objectives of the Application of Usability Tests

The main objectives of doing the testing are:
- Obtain objective measurements on the state of key Quality Attributes related to the system.
- Determine if the users are comfortable with the UI proposed.
- Find possible opportunities of improvement.

### Tools

The instruments and tools used for the application and data collection of the usability test are listed below:

- Figma (Software for designing and prototyping) 
- Maze (Software built for testing)
- Google Forms 
- Microsoft Excel 
- Microsoft Teams

The materials used for the application of the Usability Test are the following:

- Prototypes on Figma
- Maze test
- SUS Survey on Google Forms

## Usability Metrics 

The Usability Metrics intended for measuring High Priority Quality Attributes are as follows:
- [Effectiveness Rate of Performing Tasks](../../Requirements/Metrics%20Related%20to%20Quality%20Attributes.md#effectiveness-rate-of-performing-tasks) (Target Quality Attribute: [Efficiency](../../Requirements/Requirements%20Definition.md#efficiency))
- [Number of User Errors](../../Requirements/Metrics%20Related%20to%20Quality%20Attributes.md#number-of-user-errors) (Target Quality Attribute: [Efficiency](../../Requirements/Requirements%20Definition.md#efficiency))
- [Interface Satisfaction Level](../../Requirements/Metrics%20Related%20to%20Quality%20Attributes.md#interface-satisfaction-level) (Target Quality Attribute: [Satisfaction](../../Requirements/Requirements%20Definition.md#satisfaction))
- [Interface Simplicity Level](../../Requirements/Metrics%20Related%20to%20Quality%20Attributes.md#interface-simplicity-level) (Target Quality Attribute: [Simplicity](../../Requirements/Requirements%20Definition.md#simplicity))

The complete information on each metric can be found in the [Metrics Related to Quality Attributes](../../Requirements/Metrics%20Related%20to%20Quality%20Attributes.md) document.
